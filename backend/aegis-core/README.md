# Aegis Core

The domain and pipeline service for Aegis (Java / Spring): the inventory & map of the estate,
advisory ingestion, matching, scoring, and the execution of approved actions. The AI steps
(**assess** and **draft**) live in a separate Python **ai-service**, reached through the `ai` port.
See the root [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md), [`BUILD_PLAN.md`](../../BUILD_PLAN.md), and
[`docs/adr/0001-aegis-core-language.md`](../../docs/adr/0001-aegis-core-language.md).

> **Status: scaffold.** Runnable skeleton — Spring Boot app, resource-server security, the `core`
> schema, the module seams, and the AI port (interfaces + DTOs + a wired-but-unimplemented HTTP
> client). No domain logic yet; that lands feature by feature (BUILD_PLAN step 1 onward).

## Modules (a modular monolith, split by seams later)

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `inventory` | Services, components, vendors, SBOM dependencies, ownership — the map |
| `ingestion` | Scheduled feed polling (OSV / NVD / vendor) → normalised advisories *(queue seam)* |
| `matching`  | Advisory package + version range → components → impacted services/owners → findings |
| `scoring`   | Deterministic impact score per service and owner, with a "why" breakdown |
| `actions`   | Execute human-approved responses (PR / ticket / memo), audited |
| `ai`        | **Port** to the Python ai-service: `AiAssessor` / `AiDrafter` + DTOs + `HttpAiClient` |

## The AI boundary

The AI logic is **not** in this service. `ai` holds only the seam: the domain depends on the
`AiAssessor` / `AiDrafter` interfaces; the one implementation (`HttpAiClient`) calls the internal
ai-service over REST with a **service token** (`X-Service-Token`), not a user JWT. Transport (REST
now, a queue later) and the LLM provider can change behind these interfaces without touching the
domain. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the topology.

## How it runs

- **Port** `8082` (`SERVER_PORT`).
- **Database** — shares one PostgreSQL instance with identity-service; owns the **`core`** schema.
  Plain relational store (no pgvector — RAG belongs to the ai-service). Flyway manages the schema.
- **Auth** — OAuth2 resource server; validates identity-service's RS256 JWTs via its JWKS
  (`IDENTITY_JWKS_URI`), maps the `roles` claim, and authorizes per route.
- **Observability** — `/actuator/health|info|prometheus`, traces to Zipkin (propagated to the ai-service).

### Key environment variables

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVER_PORT` | `8082` | HTTP port |
| `DB_URL` / `DB_USER` / `DB_PASSWORD` | `…/identity`, `identity`, `identity` | Shared datasource |
| `IDENTITY_JWKS_URI` | `http://localhost:8081/oauth2/jwks` | identity-service's public keys |
| `AI_SERVICE_URI` | `http://localhost:8083` | The internal ai-service base URL |
| `AI_SERVICE_TOKEN` | `dev-internal-token-change-me` | Shared service token sent to the ai-service |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000` | SPA origins allowed in dev |
| `ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans` | Trace collector |

## Build & test

```bash
# from backend/aegis-core
mvn clean test          # compiles + runs the smoke test (needs Docker for Testcontainers)
mvn spring-boot:run     # run locally (needs Postgres on :5432 and identity-service on :8081)
```

In Docker Compose it builds and starts alongside identity-service and the ai-service. API docs at
`http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html` once endpoints exist.
